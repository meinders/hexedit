hexedit
=======

A touch-compatible hex editor. So far, this is only a proof of concept that is built using Swing,
which doesn't actually run on typical touch-capable devices.

For a recent project I had to dig into a file with a hex editor. They usually do the job, but the
user interface hasn't changed much since the 90's. So I thought I'd have a go at making a pretty
hex editor for a change. (I'll admit I'm not much of a designer though. Don't blame me if it hurts
your eyes.)
